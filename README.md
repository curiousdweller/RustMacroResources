# RustMacroResources
List of useful resources that helped me in understanding Macros in Rust. Working down the list is recommended.

* The Rust Book - chapter 19.5
* Proc Macro example: https://tinkering.xyz/introduction-to-proc-macros/ Further resources listed in this article, although some are outdated.
* Rust Macro Book: https://danielkeep.github.io/tlborm/book/index.html The Rust Reference is useful here, to look at certain definitions such as the grammar in Rust.
* Familiarise yourself with the Syn and Quote crates
* Jon Gjengest on Youtube (2 Videos on Proc Macros, VERY_LONG_but_good_quality, 1 on Declarative Macros)
* Look through a crate you like and see how they use Macros. Tokio is a good place to start.
* Finally, experiment with your own macros, maybe you can implement some of your favourite features of another programming langauge using macros. Also take a look at some of the compiler built in Macros, as they are regurlarly used.
